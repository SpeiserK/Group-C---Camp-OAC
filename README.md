COSC 499 Capstone Project
a MobileFriendly website to automate the process of obtaining campfire wood <br />
This automation process looks like: <br />
(1) user views advertisement on Facebook or any other site; <br />
(2) clicks link/hotspot and is directed to our wood sales web site (to be created as part of this project); <br />
(3) chooses the location (from list of available locations), and number of bags of firewood desired; <br />
(4) receives automatically an invoice that is produced based on pricing and quantity desired; <br />
(5) makes payment or retains invoice for cash payment upon pick up. Receipt is generated automatically.
