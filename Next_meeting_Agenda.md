# Camp OAC Meeting Agenda #3


## Questions
### Question 1: What is your preferred way we handle users that would prefer to pay with cash? We had discussed previously that we did not want users to see location until they were a confirmed customer and had paid for the service. This was for privacy reasons of the selling locations. However if the user wants to pay with cash they would need to be given the address to make the transaction. 

We have brainstormed 3 potential solutions to this problem:

*Option 1*: We allow the users an option to pay with cash. The website informs the seller that the purchaser has made an order so that the correct quantity is set aside. We give the purchaser the selling address and they are to pay cash when they arrive to pick up the wood. 

*Option 2*: Same as option 1 but instead of giving users an address we give them contact information of the selling location.. This is to ensure that these orders are legitimate. Once the seller has confirmed they will give the purchaser the address.

*Option 3*: To not allow cash transactions.

### Question 2: We are also wondering whether you guys would still want to accept e-transfers and whether or not these should be treated as cash?

### Question 3: Should there be a manual approval process performed by staff in selling locations when an order is placed to confirm stock? We potentially see issues arising if the stock is not updated frequently, and a large purchase is made. Ideally we would like to avoid approving orders that cannot be completed (See question 4).

Our thoughts are the customer orders the firewood, a staff member sees an order request, and clicks either tick or cross, and depending on which is pressed, the stock is updated appropriately and a text/email is sent informing the customer either the request was denied (should come with a short message as to why) or the order was approved, alongside the pickup location.

### Question 4: How do we handle orders that cannot be completed and other errors? What is the process? We think that we refund the purchase, and send a text/email informing the customer an error has occurred







Requirements:
Notification system for sellers when sale is made so sellers can set aside the right quantity of wood.
